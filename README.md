Hand Tracking, Finger Counting & Pose Estimation with OpenCV
This repository contains Python applications that utilize OpenCV for real-time hand tracking, finger counting, and pose estimation. The project demonstrates how computer vision techniques can be applied to detect and track hands, count fingers, and estimate body poses for various interactive applications.

Features
Hand Tracking: Detects and tracks hand movements in real-time using webcam input.
Finger Counting: Recognizes and counts the number of fingers shown in front of the camera.
Pose Estimation: Estimates the pose of the human body, providing keypoints for limbs and body position.
Lesson Tutorials: Includes detailed lessons and explanations to help you understand and implement the techniques used in the project.
Additionally, the repository contains:

A Python script with all the functionalities integrated.
A detailed OpenCV technique guide in a text file, providing more in-depth explanations of the algorithms used.
